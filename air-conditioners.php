		<h2>Is it time for a new air conditioner?</h2>

		<p>When summer temperatures and humidity arrive in Ohio, you need an air conditioner that’s ready to perform to
			your expectations. If your current central air system isn’t up to the task, it’s time to upgrade.
			Performance Heating and Cooling installs advanced, affordable, energy-efficient, and high-performance air
			conditioners and cooling systems for both homes and businesses.</p>
		<p>Our comfort designers will tailor your needs to the perfect-sized system for your home or business. We are
			committed to giving our customers the air conditioning solution that is right for them at fair prices.</p>

		<h2>So What Does the SEER Rating of an AC system Mean?</h2>

		<p>SEER stands for "Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio," and it is a measure of the cooling output of an air
			conditioning system over a typical cooling season, divided by the amount of energy consumed in watt-hours.
			season.</p>


		<h2>Variable-Capacity AC Compressor</h2>

		<p>The Variable-capacity compressor also called Variable Speed is currently our most efficient and quietest
			option. It can operate at various speeds depending on the cooling requirements, ranging from 35-100%.
			Compared to two-stage systems, it offers a wider range of speeds, enabling the air conditioning to maintain
			lower speeds for longer durations while providing the option for higher speeds when the outdoor temperature
			rises. As a result, variable-speed AC systems run continuously without frequent on/off cycles and only at
			the required speed to keep you comfortable, making them the most energy-efficient among the three types of
			AC systems.</p>

		<h2>Two-Stage / Multi Stage AC Compressor</h2>

		<p>The two-stage AC compressor operates at two levels: high for extremely hot summer days and low for milder
			summer
			days. With a two-stage AC unit, you essentially get two units for the price of one. On days with moderate
			temperatures, the compressor initially runs at 70%, and if it fails to cool the house to the desired level,
			it
			moves to 100%. Since the low setting is adequate for cooling homes 80% of the time, a two-stage unit
			operates
			for more extended periods, resulting in a more uniform indoor air temperature. Compared to a single-stage
			compressor, the two-stage compressor is more efficient because it doesn't cycle on and off as frequently,
			reducing wear and tear. Moreover, the two-stage system removes twice as much humidity as the single-stage
			system
			because it operates at the lower level for an extended period.</p>


		<h2>Single-Stage AC Compressor</h2>
		<p>A single-stage AC compressor functions at a constant full-cold speed, with the thermostat controlling the
			home's
			temperature by turning the AC system and compressor on and off. In Ohio, most homes with central air
			conditioning use a single-stage compressor, which has been the standard for several decades. The latest
			single-stage models feature cutting-edge technology, making them considerably more energy-efficient than
			their
			older counterparts, which had much lower SEER ratings.</p>

		<h2>Customized Heating Solutions</h2>
		<p>Performance Heating and Cooling offers customized home comfort solutions that take into account factors such
			as
			home size, design, climate, insulation, and occupants' behavior to find the most affordable and
			energy-efficient
			option. They only recommend products that meet their strict criteria and provide detailed explanations,
			recommendations, and load calculations to ensure equipment is correctly sized for the home. Their goal is to
			provide quality customer service and build lasting relationships with customers.</p>
