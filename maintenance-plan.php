        <h2>Annual Performance Maintenance Plan</h2>

        <p> As your Heating and Cooling equipment ages, the more valuable a maintenance program becomes. The savings
            from
            one major repair could save you more than the service agreement itself. Regular service of your equipment is
            like changing the oil in your vehicle. You can save thousands in energy costs and future repairs, as well as
            extend the life of your HVAC system.</p>

        <h2> Top Priority Status</h2>

        <p> You are a Performance Maintenance Plan Client, when you have the Annual Performance Maintenance Plan. That
            means
            when you need service, you get it NOW - no lengthy waiting when your system is out of order. Performance
            Heating
            and Cooling have emergency service available 24 hours per day, every day of the week.</p>



        <h2> Longer Equipment Life</h2>

        <p> With the special care, you receive with the Performance Maintenance Plan, your heating and cooling equipment
            will last longer and run more efficiently.</p>



        <h2>Energy Savings</h2>

        <p> The money you'll save by maintaining your equipment in top running order with a Performance Maintenance Plan
            membership will add up to big savings on your heating and cooling costs.</p>



        <h2>Fulfillment of Warranty Requirements</h2>
        <p>If your HVAC components are under warranty, you should know that most manufacturers require evidence of
            annual
            maintenance to pay a claim. An investment in regular maintenance is essentially giving you an insurance
            policy.
            If something malfunctions that are covered under warranty, youâ€™ll be able to file your claim with more
            confidence and ease with evidence of annual maintenance.</p>


        <h2>What's Included?</h2>
        <p> Your yearly maintenance agreement includes priority scheduling, discounts on service calls, and protection
            for
            your HVAC equipment.</p>
        <p>You can individually protect your furnace (plus hot water heater) and air conditioner, or choose combined
            protection for both at a reduced price.</p>
