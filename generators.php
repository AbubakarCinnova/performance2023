 <h1>Automatic Standby Back Up Generators for Homes and Businesses </h2>
 <p>Having a reliable automatic standby generator is imperative to ensure your home or business has 24/7 protection from power disruptions. After all, nobody wants to deal with the hassle of being without the lights, air conditioning, heating and other appliances in your home during a power outage.</p>

   <h2>Have Peace Of Mind When The Power Goes out</h3>
    <p><img src="<?php echo $base_url ?>/img/gen-pic.jpg" style="float: right; width:40%;" alt="image" class="img-responsive">Today’s generators are quiet and can power your whole home or business. Whole house generators keep the lights, security system, sump pump, television, healthcare equipment, heating and cooling system, even the fridge working during electrical power outages. A standby generator detects when the power is cut to your house and automatically starts up in a few seconds to restore full electrical power to your home, now that's peace of mind.</p>
