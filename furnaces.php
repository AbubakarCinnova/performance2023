								<h1>Furnaces</h1>
								<p>As a homeowner, one of the hardest decisions you'll have to make about your Furnace
									is when it's time for a new heating system.</p>

								<p>You're researching online or have heard talk about variable speed furnaces,
									single-stage, two-stage, modulating gas furnaces, and AFUE ratings. Let us help you
									by explaining some of those furnace systems and related terms.</p>



								<h2>Furnace Efficiency Rating AFUE</h2>
								<p>AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) measures the efficiency of modern furnaces
									by comparing the furnace's annual heat output to its total fossil fuel consumption.
									A furnace with a 99 AFUE rating returns 99 cents of heat per dollar spent, while 1
									cent is lost. The AFUE rating doesn't include heat loss through ducts. </p>

								<h2>Variable Capacity Furnace also called Modulating gas furnaces</h2>
								<p>A variable capacity furnace, also known as a modulating gas furnace, is an advanced
									type of heating system that adjusts its output between 35% and 100% depending on the
									heating demand. This allows it to use only the amount of fuel necessary to maintain
									the desired temperature. These furnaces are among the most energy-efficient on the
									market, with an efficiency rating of 99%.</p>

								<h2>Two Stage Furnace</h2>
								<p>A two-stage furnace has two heat output levels, one for mild and one for cold
									weather. It saves energy and reduces noise by running at a lower speed during mild
									weather, and provides more heat during cold days by running at full capacity. This
									leads to energy savings and better comfort. Though it has a higher initial cost, it
									saves on monthly heating bills.</p>


								<h2>Variable Speed Furnace</h2>
								<p>A variable-speed furnace is a type of heating system that uses a variable-speed
									blower motor to adjust the airflow through the furnace. This allows the furnace to
									adjust the fan speed based on heating demand, resulting in better temperature
									control, improved indoor air quality, and consistent temperature, and reduces the
									number of times the furnace has to cycle on and off. This makes it more energy
									efficient and cost-effective than traditional, fixed-speed furnaces.</p>

								<h2>Single Stage Furnace</h2>
								<p>The single-stage furnace is the most basic and affordable option among all types of
									furnaces. It is also the simplest in terms of technology. However, this simplicity
									comes at a cost of energy efficiency, resulting in higher monthly utility bills.
									This is because a single-stage furnace uses the same flame size to produce heat,
									regardless of the temperature inside or outside.</p>

								<h2> Dual Fuel HVAC</h2>
								<p>A dual-fuel HVAC system is a way to heat and cool a home using two different fuel
									sources. It uses an electric heat pump and a gas, propane, or oil furnace.During
									cooler weather, the heat pump can heat the home. During cold weather, the furnace
									is used to heat the home, and during warm weather, the heat pump acts as an air
									conditioner. The system is useful for people who live in rural areas where natural
									gas
									is not available and must rely on propane or oil for heating. It can also be
									beneficial
									for people who have access to natural gas but have a source of inexpensive
									electricity,
									like solar panels.</p>



								<h2>Customized Heating Solutions</h2>
								<p>Performance Heating and Cooling offers customized home heating solutions that take
									into
									account factors such as home size, design, climate, and insulation to find the most
									affordable and energy-efficient option. They only recommend products that meet their
									strict criteria and provide detailed explanations, recommendations, and load
									calculations to ensure equipment is correctly sized for the home. Their goal is to
									provide quality customer service and build lasting relationships with customers.</p>
