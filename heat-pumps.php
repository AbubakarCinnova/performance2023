                                <p><strong>A Dual-Function Heating and Cooling Solution for Ohio Homes</strong></p>

                                <p>A heat pump is a dual-function system that can both heat and cool a home, making it a
                                    versatile option for homeowners in Ohio. Combining a heat pump with a furnace
                                    creates a
                                    dual fuel system that ensures year-round comfort, with the heat pump operating as an
                                    air
                                    conditioner in summer and extracting heat from the outdoor air and transferring it
                                    inside in winter.</p>

                                <p> For optimal performance, a heat pump is most effective when temperatures are above
                                    30
                                    degrees Fahrenheit, and a furnace can take over in colder weather. Homeowners in
                                    Ohio
                                    may need a supplemental heating source when temperatures drop significantly.
                                    However,
                                    combining a Lennox heat pump with an efficient furnace can create an energy-saving
                                    dual-fuel system that reduces gas fuel consumption and ensures maximum comfort on
                                    extra-cold days.</p>


                                <p>Energy efficiency is affected by a variety of factors, including the design, size,
                                    and
                                    maintenance of the HVAC system, climate, building insulation, and occupants'
                                    behavior.
                                    Our comfort designers can conduct proper analysis and load calculations to help in
                                    selecting the most suitable HVAC system for a home or business.</p>
