 <h2>Installation Guide</h2>

    <p>At Performance Heating and Cooling. we know that the decision to purchase new heating and air conditioning equipment can be an intimidating and confusing process. We also know that most home and business owners only make this decision a handful of times in their lives, if ever. This guide is designed to walk you through this process step by step. We want to make the decision to work with us as easy as possible.</p>

    <p>Scheduling is easy. A customer service specialist is available to take your call to schedule a free in-home consultation. 
    Appointment times are incredibly flexible. We prefer that if there is more than one decision maker involved in the process 
    (and there usually is!) that everyone involved be present for the appointment.</p>

    <p>On your scheduled day, your comfort specialist will arrive and begin by asking you a series of simple questions to get a feel for your needs, your concerns, your budget, and your timeline. After carefully surveying your home and existing HVAC equipment setup, they will usually, in the same visit, be able to present you with a series of options they feel will best fit your needs. The comfort specialists goal is to help you select the system that is a great fit for you and your space. We offer a variety of financing and payment options to help make the purchasing decision easier. Your comfort specialist is fully equipped to assist in securing this financing.</p>

    <p>Your comfort specialist and installation manager will work with you to schedule a time for your installation. Most installations take no longer than one day; and you will be fully aware of the required schedule. The installing technicians, led by a team leader, will arrive and begin your installation. They will protect their work area and the route to it through your home. They will work to remove any old equipment and then begin placing the new equipment. When they have finished their installation, they will tidy up their work space and the team leader will do a final walk-through, making sure to demonstrating any important features and controls with you.</p>

    <p>Once your new system has been installed our dedicated staff of back-office personnel will continue working behind the scenes to ensure that the final pieces of your installation come together. They will put together your warranty registration, receipts, and any maintenance agreements and get them sent over to you as quickly as possible.</p><br>
